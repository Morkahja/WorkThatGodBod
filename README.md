WorkThatGodBod
==============

WorkThatGodBod is a lightweight Turtle WoW addon that gently reminds you to move, hydrate, and fix your posture while you play.

It works by watching a chosen action bar slot. When that slot is pressed, the addon may print a short, real-world movement or posture prompt in chat. No timers, no UI, no nagging—just small nudges when you’re already in motion.

Features
--------
• Random posture, movement, and hydration prompts  
• Fully random selection, no categories  
• Vanilla 1.12.1 / Lua 5.0 safe  
• Zero UI, chat-only output  
• Saved settings per character  

Commands
--------
/godbod watch  
Shows which action bar slot you press, so you can identify the slot number.

/godbod slot <number>  
Sets the action bar slot that triggers reminders.

/godbod cd <seconds>  
Sets the minimum time between reminders.

/godbod chance <0-100>  
Sets the chance that a reminder appears when triggered.

/godbod on | off  
Enables or disables the addon.

/godbod info  
Shows current settings.

Notes
-----
This addon does not track time, performance, or behavior.  
It exists to break long sessions into small moments of movement without turning play into work.

Move a little. Drink water. Keep playing.
